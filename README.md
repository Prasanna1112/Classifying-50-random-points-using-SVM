# About SVM:

Support Vector Machine(SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges. 
However,  it is mostly used in classification problems. 
In this algorithm, each data is plotted in n-dimensional space (where n is the number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. 
After that, we perform classification by locating the hyperplane which differentiates both the classes.

Support vector machine is based on the concept of decision planes that define decision boundaries. 
A decision plane(hyperplane) is one that separates between a set of objects with different class memberships.


# Steps to build:

1)	Before running the code, please make sure to install all the necessary libraries.
2)	Once the libraries are installed, simply build the program and the output will yield.
3)	A new pop-up window will show up with the SVM classified randomly generated data-points.
